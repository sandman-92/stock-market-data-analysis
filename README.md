## introduction
The main goal of this notebook is for me to learn how to use jupyter notebooks.

I thought I would use this oppertunity to build on the excellent [youtube tutorial series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_L9jR8P-54)

This notebook currently:
 1. goes to wikipedia and downloads a list of company symbols of the SPY500
 2. uses yfinance to get historic company data for every company
 3. calculates the daily % gain/loss for each company
 4. counts the number of times the daily gain / loss was over a certain percentage
